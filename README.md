# neovim configuration

This will serve as documentation for my vimrc config used on all my machines.
For now you will need to install [vim-plug](junegunn/vim-plug) for this
configuration to work with the plugins, though the plugin's could be installed
with other vim plugin managers.

Put this config into `$HOME/.config/nvim/` and you might want to link it to
`$HOME/.vimrc`
